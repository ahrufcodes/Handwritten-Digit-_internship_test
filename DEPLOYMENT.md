## 📋 Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:

- [x] **Repository is public** (required for free deployment)
- [x] **All files are committed and pushed**
- [x] **Model file exists** (`vae_mnist_model.pth`)
- [x] **Latent means file exists** (`digit_latent_means.pkl`)
- [x] **Requirements.txt is up to date**
- [x] **README.md is comprehensive**
- [x] **App runs locally** (test with `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. Model file not found**
```
Solution: Ensure vae_mnist_model.pth is committed to git
```

**2. Memory issues**
```
Solution: Model file (2.5MB) should be within limits for all platforms
```

**3. Dependencies not installing**
```
Solution: Check requirements.txt format and versions
```

**4. App not starting**
```
Solution: Test locally first with: streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## 📊 Expected Performance

- **Deployment time**: 2-3 minutes
- **Cold start time**: 10-15 seconds
- **Generation time**: <1 second per request
- **Concurrent users**: 50+ (depending on platform)

## 🌐 Public Access Requirements

Your deployed app will:
- ✅ Be publicly accessible for 2+ weeks
- ✅ Support concurrent users
- ✅ Generate digits 0-9 on demand
- ✅ Display 5 unique samples per digit
- ✅ Remain active (platforms auto-sleep but wake on access)

## 📱 Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test:
1. Visit the public URL
2. Try generating each digit (0-9)
3. Verify 5 unique samples are generated
4. Check responsiveness on mobile/desktop
5. Test with multiple users (if available)

## 🔗 Update README

After successful deployment, update the README.md badge:
```markdown
[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://your-actual-app-url.streamlit.app/)
```
